Scruffy Video
=============

Some little utilities I use a lot working with Vimeo and YouTube. 
They'll become more robust over time. Pull requests welcome.

The only requirement is [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/). You probably need Python 2.7.

To install, `pip install git+https://github.com/whatisjasongoldstein/scruffy-video.git#egg=scruffy-video`

The rest should be pretty self-explanatory: import functions, pass in a Vimeo or YouTube link, and get back useful things.

YouTube now requires at API key, which is lame.
